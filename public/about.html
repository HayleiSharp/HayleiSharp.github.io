  Hello! My name is Haylei Sharp, and I am an 18-year-old self-taught website developer.
  Through Udemy, I have been able to learn and pick up skills that have helped in my 
  journey. I enjoy all things creative, including drawing, writing, playing music, and 
  dancing!

  In high school, I was part of our theatre program. From the second I joined, I tried 
  to be as active of a member as I possibly could be. I did everything (not at once) from 
  costume designing, microphone handling, planning meetings, until eventually making 
  my way to the front of the stage. My senior year of high school, I was given the 
  opportunity to become president of our club. It was a phenomenal role I was allowed 
  that led me to grow closer to my community while helping us become our best.

  One of my favorite learning experiences was being in my Advanced Placement Art 
  Studio class. In this class, we had to pump out artworks every few days that aligned 
  with our theme. Being a perfectionist with little time to make my "perfect" pieces 
  frustrated me, but it also helped me to learn time management and patience. At times 
  when I was feeling low, I would conspire with my classmates about their artworks, 
  their themes, and the multitude of ways to make art. My favorite memory of this class, was 
  actually a time when I wasn't even in class. The "Art Showdown" was an event where 
  select students were allowed to compete in bizarre art competitions, ranging from 
  drawing 15 second portraits to making an entire pizza sculpture out of trash assigned 
  to your group. I was graciously given the opportunity to compete twice under the painting 
  category. My second year, the theme for the painting category was "togetherness." 
  Throughout the painting process, my group had to modify our work multiple times as 
  part of the challeneges. I remember a specific time when we had to cover and block out 
  1/3 of our painting with only 10 minutes remaining in the challenge. Regardless, my 
  group excelled and we all had so much fun with the artwork. In the end, we even won 
  for our paint group! I think back on the community and how all schools would come 
  together and bond over each others' artwork, and I am forever grateful for the chance 
  that I was given.

  In my free time, drawing and writing are my favorite outlets. Writing has always been 
  a favorite of mine. When I was a kid, I would draw out characters and write little stories
  to go along with them. Even now, when I write, sometimes I like to draw pictures out 
  beside my work to get a better visual. I believe this is why I've grown such a liking 
  to coding. Nothing is more satisfying than designing my own page from start to finish and 
  being able to see my work displayed in real time. I love being able to decorate and 
  design to my heart's content while writing the entire thing out. Coding has quickly 
  become another creative outlet for me.
