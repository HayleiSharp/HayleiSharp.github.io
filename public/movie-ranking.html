<h1>Haylei's Movie Rankings</h1>

<h3>1. Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Of course, my first pick had to be the Studio Ghibli timeless classic "Howl's Moving Castle." With<br />
    beautiful, hand-drawn imagery, a chilling live orchestra, passionate voice actors, and compelling<br />
    characters, it's hard not to enjoy this masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki. </p>

<h3>2. Bullet Train</h3>
<p>Taking a sharp shift in directions, my second favorite movie at the moment would go to the 2022 movie<br />
    "Bullet Train" directed by David Leitch. What starts as a simple dark-comedy spy movie takes a sudden<br />
    change and then becomes the funniest most unfortunate sequence of events. Throughout the movie,<br />
    various characters are introduced with their own motives all meeting together on a japanese bullet train.<br />
    Overall, the movie is hilariously dry-humored with an excellent casting. </p>

<h3>3. Princess and the Frog</h3>
<p>Continuing the world's most unorganized movie ranking, my next movie of all time is the beautiful <br />
    Disney movie "The Princess and the Frog." I've watched this movie about a trillion gazillion times, and<br />
    even then it never gets old. Anika Noni Rose's performance as Tiana is absolutely breathtaking and <br />
    genuinely gives me chills every time. It's hard not to fall in love with all the bizarre characters, from <br />
    a lovestruck firefly, to an extravagent crocodile who just wants to play jazz, to our hard-working and <br />
    ambitious heroine. Fair warning, though. These catchy, angelic tuned songs will 100% get stuck in your <br />
    head. </p>
